Hello I am Ayush Kumar Rai! I am registering for all categories in the HackTheLib Event! I am working alone, and am an 8th grader at mead jr high, in elk grove, il, usa.
You have to run my project by downloading it, and running it through any shell and using flask. This is my first time making a web app, hope you like it.
